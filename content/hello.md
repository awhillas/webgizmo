# Gizmo says: Hi World!

If you see this in place of your website then you installed Gizmo correctly. 

You now might like to:

- edit the `index.php` file to change the name of the site and choose a template.
- Delete this file and replace it with your own website content. Just look in the `/content` folder.

For more details on what you can do with content see the [Publishers section](http://gizmo.tsd.net.au/Publishers) of the [Web Gizmo](http://gizmo.tsd.net.au) website.

Enjoy!
