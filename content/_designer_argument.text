## Web Designers

Templates are HTML & CSS
: Gizmo uses the Savant3 template system which is basic HTML & CSS so you can create your layouts in WYSIWYG applications, like Dreamweaver, and place the simple content hooks in the right place and your done. 

Complex Layouts
: Its easy to place content into complex layouts with the simple [file name tagging system](). You can also define as many templates as you like or as few depending on your requirements. _Complete control_.

Easy Content Management
: No databases or cryptic web forms. All content is organised into a folder hierarchy. If you know how to make folders and put files in them you already know how to manage a Gizmo website. Because markup is with Markdown or Textile clients can't mess up the content beyond what you have styled for.
