Separation of Content and Design
: Content is kept separate and in standard formats so you have _low commitment_ to Gizmo. On the flip side this make Gizmo a natural choice for integrating with existing file content even in parallel to other heavier CMS systems.

Simple query language
: interface to the file system. A JQuery style API for chaining filtering and sorting commands together.

Easy Deployment
: No database setup or configuration is required to get Gizmo going. Simply upload Gizmo plus your content and its away. Gizmo is also flexible and there are many configuration options for fine tuning it to your needs.
